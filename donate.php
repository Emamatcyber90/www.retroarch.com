                <h1>Ways to donate</h1>
                <p>RetroArch/Libretro is a big project that consumes a lot of our resources and time. An impressive amount of spinoff products and derivatives (the vast majority not even affiliated with our project) all depend on its continuing development and online services.</p>
                <p>To keep the show ongoing, there are various ways you can support the project.</p>

     <h1>Patreon</h1>
      <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=4061686"><img src="images/patron.png" align="middle" /></a>
     <p>You can pledge a monthly amount to our Patreon. This is the main bulk of our current support.</p>
     <h1>Liberate</h1>
     <p>You can decide to pledge a weekly amount to our Liberapay account. This might be an alternative if Patreon is not an option.</p>

     <p>Another way of supporting us is by donating some Bitcoins. These are one-off donations, suitable for when monthly recurring donations like Patreon are not an option for you.</p>
     <h1>Bountysource</h1>
     <a href="https://salt.bountysource.com/checkout/amount?team=libretro"><img src="images/bountysource.png" align="middle" /></a>
     <p>We use funds from our Patreon on a periodic basis for the purpose of funding and creating new bounties. Bounties help the project accomplish its goals and to fix issues, both existing and new ones.</p>
     <p>If you would like to directly fund a bounty, you can create your own bounty by going to the <a href="https://github.com/libretro">libretro Github repository</a> first, and then typing in the name of the repository inside Bountysource and specifying the amount of money you want to pledge.</p>
     <p>If you would like to contribute to our bounty funds directly (to leave it at our discretion how we will appropriate it for the bounty system), you can do so by clicking on the Bountysource logo above.</p>
     <h1>Community-funded</h1>
     <p>It borders on cliche at this point, but it really is true - this project is wholly community-funded, and the users' continued patronage keeps this project going. Server costs keep escalating as we expand and become bigger, so does the amount of bandwidth we use up as more and more spinoff projects keep depending on our infrastructure. Contributions therefore are not only desired but absolutely necessary if we are to continue.</p>
