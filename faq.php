        <h2>Which core is the best to emulate (some console / game) ?</h2>
        <div class="row platforms">
        There is no best core, each has a different use case (accuracy, speed...).
        </div>
     <h2>I can't load / the core crashes on startup with (some game)</h2>
     <div class="row platforms">
      It's either because :
<ul>
 <li>You are missing a required file like the BIOS or the name is not exact
  (you can check it under main menu -> load core -> information -> core information)</li>
 <li>The core doesn't support your game</li>
 <li>Your ROM is a bad dump</li>
 <li>The core doesn't support the video driver you are using</li>
 <li>If you are using a disc-based game (bin + cue archive) you need to unzip it</li>
      </ul>
     </div>
     <h2>Why does some core / game run slowly ?</h2>
     <div class="row platforms">It is likely because your system is too slow.</div>
     
     <h1>Windows platform-specific</h1>
     <h2>When I try to load a core on RetroArch it says "No Core"</h2>
     <div class="row platforms">
      It's either because :
      <ul>
       <li>You need to download the MSVC Runtime</li>
       <li>You need to update RetroArch</li>
      </ul>
     </div>
     
     <h2>I can't see (some core) in the download list</h2>
<div class="row platforms">
 Maybe you have accidentally downloaded the Windows XP build, which is not compatible with all cores.
